Please fill out the following form to submit your talk. Submitting multiple talks is perfectly acceptable - we
will speak with you before we select more than one to ensure you are prepared for that situation. First time
speakers are also quite welcome, as are presenters from far beyond the Greater Pittsburgh area. If you have any
questions, send them to [Eric Kepes](mailto:ekepes@gmail.com).
